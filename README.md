# Prediction of the demand for shared BoomBikes
> In this assignment we need to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## General Information
- We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
- It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
- They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

## Conclusions
- Demand of bikes depend on year, workingday, temp, windspeed, july, sep, sat, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.
